			<p>Consumers today have choices and lots of them. That is why focusing on their experience and exceeding their expectations is crucial to our own success. By combining my support skills with my interest in technology and marketing, I bring a very holistic approach to my work. I am motivated by the challenge and opportunity to help shape the customer's journey, whether B2B or B2C.</p>

			<p>When I am not directly engaging with customers to answer their questions, I am troubleshooting and documenting issues, testing upcoming changes, updating internal and external documentation and looking for additional ways to maximize the impact of my team and value we provide. I also enjoy fostering those same skills in others.</p>
